drvPciMcor:
	slim pseudo 'driver' which just provides 'init' and 'report' entry
    points.

      'init' uses drvUioPciGen to scan the PCI bus for MCOR devices and
             register them with devBusMapped.

      'report' prints info about found MCOR devices.

    USAGE
    =====

      To build an application make sure the Makefile contains

         app_DBD += epicspci.dbd
         app_DBD += devBusMapped.dbd
         app_DBD += drvUioPciGen.dbd
         app_DBD += drvMcorPci.dbd

         app_LIBS += drvMcorPci
         app_LIBS += drvUioPciGen
         app_LIBS += epicspci
         app_LIBS += devBusMapped

      (of course, the RELEASE file must list all the respective EPICS modules
       and their dependencies - have fun).
